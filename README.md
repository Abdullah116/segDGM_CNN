# Deep Gray Matter (DGM) Segmentation using 3D Convolutional Neural Network: application to QSM

This work is based on:
* Jose Dolz, Christian Desrosiers, Ismail Ben Ayed, *3D fully convolutional networks for subcortical segmentation in MRI: A large-scale study*, In NeuroImage, 2017
* joseabernal's solution for iSeg2017. [Github](https://github.com/joseabernal/iSeg2017-nic_vicorob)
